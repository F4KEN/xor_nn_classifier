# XOR Neural Network Classifier

This project implements a basic feedforward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to learn the XOR logic gate.

## Features

- Fully connected neural network architecture.
- Customizable number of layers and activation functions.
- Early stopping and optional TensorBoard support.
- Model saving and reloading.

## Files

- `xor_classifier.py`: The main training and evaluation script.
- `xor_model.h5`: Saved model file after training (generated after run).

## How to Run

```bash
python xor_classifier.py
```

## Output

- Accuracy and loss plots.
- Printed predictions and confusion matrix.
- Saved model as `xor_model.h5`.
